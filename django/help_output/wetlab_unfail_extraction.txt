Delete the latest ExtractionFail for a given Sample. We sometimes need to
override an automatic failed extraction to allow a sample with e.g. low volume
to continue through the pipeline. This command is only applicable to samples
that have no working_extraction, and have at least one failed extraction (i.e.
a non-None latest_failed_extraction). If the sample doesn't have an associated
dilution, create it from the sample's NormData. Abort if the sample has
multiple dilutions.
