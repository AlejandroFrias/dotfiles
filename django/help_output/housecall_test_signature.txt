Tool to see how a GC's signature will look on a report PDF. Example:
./manage.py housecall_test_signature fake_kenny@counsyl.com signature.png The
above command generates a fake consultation report by Kenny Wong, with the
given signature image. The fake GCs have to exist already; create them with
`./manage.py housecall_create_fake_gcs`. The report is saved to
./test_signature.pdf, overwriting any existing file by that name. Tips for a
good-looking signature: - Adjust contrast to turn the scan into a sharp black
and white image. - Use a PNG instead of JPG to avoid artifacts. - If you have
a large image, increase the DPI to 200 instead of reducing the resolution.
This will look better if the PDF is printed. (Note: the signature might look
too large in the consultation report editor, but it will have a proper size in
the PDF.) - Leave a _small_ white margin on all sides.
