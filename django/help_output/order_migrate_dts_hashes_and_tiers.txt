Update report_hash, autopass_tier, and cache for DTS orders. The hashing
function was changed for DTS orders requiring an update for all DTS orders
that already have a report_hash. Autopass tier was previously set such that no
DTS order would enter the cache. The autopass tier is recomputed using the
standard logic that checks disease classifications. Orders that have been
reviewed and pass can_enter_autopass_cache will be entered into the cache as
ReportHash instances Note that this task will take a very long time to run.
20000 Orders takes about 6 hours to run. --start and --count options allow
simple -- pagination to split the task as needed. Usage: ./manage.py
order_migrate_dts_hashes_and_tiers ./manage.py
order_migrate_dts_hashes_and_tiers --offset 100 ./manage.py

  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the

  --traceback           Raise on CommandError exceptions
  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
  --offset OFFSET       Specify the Order index to start at
  --count COUNT         Specify the number of Orders to update
