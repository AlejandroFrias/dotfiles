  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the
                        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be
                        used.
  --pythonpath PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".

  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
  --dry-run             Do not delete batches but otherwise run as normal.
                        Useful to see what would be deleted.
  --force-production    By default production batches will not be deleted. Use
                        this flag if you want to force deletion of production
                        batches.
  --force-bar           By default batches with loaded BatchAssayResult data
                        will not be deleted. Use this flag to force deletion
                        of batches with results.
