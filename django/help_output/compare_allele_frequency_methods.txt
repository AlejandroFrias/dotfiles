                                                  num_samples VCF_file_name

Compare the "fast" and "slow" frequency calculators to one another. This
command let's you compare the denominators calculated by the fast and slow
allele frequency calculators. The command requires a sample size and VCF file
name as arguments. A random sample of LaneSamples will be chosen and then the
denominators for allele frequencies from allels in those LaneSamples will be
compared between one method and the other. The denominator comparison should
always match. The command will print a message before completing indicating
whether this is the case or not.

positional arguments:
  num_samples
  VCF_file_name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -v {0,1,2,3}, --verbosity {0,1,2,3}
                        Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output,
                        2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the
                        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be
                        used.
  --pythonpath PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
  --traceback           Raise on CommandError exceptions
  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
