Move all elements from the primary queue onto secondary queue. This command
offloads the primary queue onto a secondary queue so that the primary can be
freed up for user interactions, which depend more on small lag time between
syncing their states from website to Salesforce. We should run this anytime
the queue is backed up and causing a delay that is beyond what should be
expected.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -v {0,1,2,3}, --verbosity {0,1,2,3}

  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.

                        used.
  --pythonpath PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
