Generate the PDF `Result` for a CustomerProfile given an email. This command
assumes that report data has already been loaded for the account. * If no
previous report has been created a new report will be generated. * If the
latest report has not been released to the phsyician, the original report will
be rescinded and a new report will be generated. * If the latest report has
already been released to the physician, then the report must be updated (and
the original is preserved). The updated report requires a reason and type.
