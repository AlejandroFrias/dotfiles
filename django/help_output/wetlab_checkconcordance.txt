Print out a table displaying the agreement between the concordance in the
well.qc json field and the concordance calculated by
wetlab/utils/calls.py:well_concordance Each row corresponds to a specific
batch and sample. The 'wells' column shows the wells with qc['is_qc_control']
= True, the db_concordance column shows the qc['concordance'] for those wells
(they should all be the same), the new_concordances column shows the
concordance calculate by well_concordance for each well, and match shows
whether db_concordance is an element of new_concordances to within some level
of tolerance. There is also a valid_concordances column, which is False if the
wells have different qc['concordance']'s

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit

                        2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the

                        used.
  --pythonpath PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
  --traceback           Raise on CommandError exceptions
  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
