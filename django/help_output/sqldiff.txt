                         [app_label [app_label ...]]

Prints the (approximated) difference between models and fields in the database
for the given app name(s). It indicates how columns in the database are
different from the sql that would be generated by Django. This command is not
a database migration tool. (Though it can certainly help) It's purpose is to
show the current differences as a way to check/debug ur models compared to the
real database tables and columns.

positional arguments:
  app_label

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -v {0,1,2,3}, --verbosity {0,1,2,3}
                        Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output,
                        2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the
                        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be
                        used.
  --pythonpath PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
  --traceback           Raise on CommandError exceptions
  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
  --all-applications, -a
                        Automaticly include all application from
                        INSTALLED_APPS.
  --not-only-existing, -e
                        Check all tables that exist in the database, not only
                        tables that should exist based on models.
  --dense-output, -d    Shows the output in dense format, normally output is
                        spreaded over multiple lines.
  --output_text, -t     Outputs the differences as descriptive text instead of
                        SQL
