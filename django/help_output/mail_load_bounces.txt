Load bounce records from postmark into the PostmarkBounce table. Existing
bounce records are not overwritten. New bounce records are stored by the
bounce_pingback endpoint in mail.postmark_views. This command is for loading
historical bounce records or records missed due to failure of the endpoint. To
load bounce records for one or more email addresses, specify the addresses as
positional arguments on the command line. If no addresses are given, the
command will start with the most recent bounce plus the value of the --offset
option. The command will read at most 500 (or the value of the --max-bounces
option) bounces from postmark, regardless of whether they are already in the
database or not.
