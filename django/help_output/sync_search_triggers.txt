Manage the generation of Postgres triggers required for Ticket Search Fields.
Overview - Compare
/home/alejandro/website/counsyl/product/queues/sql/ticket.sql, which holds the
current state of migrations, to the current state of database models in the
code. If no changes need to be made, this command is a no-op. - With no
arguments, this command will generate a new migration and regenerate the
fixtures. How should this be used? - During development, if models or Ticket
Search Fields are changed, then a migration and new source-controlled SQL file
(/home/alejandro/website/counsyl/product/queues/sql/ticket.sql) should be
generated using ./manage.py sync_search_triggers

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -v {0,1,2,3}, --verbosity {0,1,2,3}
                        Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output,
                        2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the
                        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be
                        used.
  --pythonpath PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
  --traceback           Raise on CommandError exceptions
  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
  --no-regenerate-sql   Skip regeneration of the source-controlled SQL file
                        holding all triggers associated with Ticket Search
                        Fields and executed on cleandb.
  --path-to-sql-file PATH_TO_SQL_FILE
                        The path to the source-controlled SQL file, holding
                        all triggers associated with Ticket SearchFields and
                        executed on cleandb. Defaults to /home/alejandro/websi
                        te/counsyl/product/queues/sql/ticket.sql.
  --print-to-screen     Instead of generating the migration containing the
                        needed forwards and backwards migration functions,
                        print them to the screen.
  --no-generate-migration
                        Do not create data migration in the Queues app.
